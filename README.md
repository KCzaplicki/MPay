## Getting started
### Setup
Get docker image from docker hub
```
docker pull krystianczaplicki/mpay
```

Start docker container with mpay image
```
docker run -it -p 5000:80 -e Webhooks__Url=http://YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL krystianczaplicki/mpay
```
Replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` with the url on which you want to get purchase updates i.e. http://localhost:5001/api/hooks/payment

üéâ **Configratulations!**  Your MPay service is ready on port **5000**. üöÄ

<br/>Now you can follow next section to prepare webhook consumer or jump to [workflow](#workflow) section to create your first purchase.<br/><br/>

### Consume webhook requests

On the webhook url provided in [setup](#setup) section you will recieve http requests with purchase updates.

Webhook http requests are **POST** type with following paylaod:

```
{
    "id": "string", // Purchase guid
    "status": number, // Purchase status
    "updatedAt": date // Update date
}
```

Purchase status can be one of these
|Name|Value|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Created|1|Purchase created, waiting for payment|
|Completed|2|Purchase paid by the user|
|Cancelled|3|Purchase cancelled by the user|
|Timeout|4|Purchase has exceeded its lifetime and has been withdrawn by the system|

<br/>You can find more about purchase statuses on [workflow](#workflow) section.

There are more configuration options available, if you want to explore them, go to [configuration](#configuration) section.

## About
MPay is a lightweight and versatile solution designed to simulate payment gateway functionality in a development or testing environment. It provides a reliable and customizable mock service that emulates the behavior and responses of a real payment gateway, allowing developers to test their applications payment integration without making actual financial transactions.

<br/>**Key Features:**

- **Simulates payment gateway behavior:** MPay accurately replicates the essential features and responses of a payment gateway, enabling developers to validate their payment processing logic effectively.

- **Customizable responses:** Developers can configure the mock service to simulate various payment scenarios, such as successful transactions, declined payments, or specific error conditions, ensuring thorough testing of their application payment handling capabilities.

- **Easy integration:** MPay is designed to be easily integrated into existing development environments. It supports popular programming languages and frameworks, providing a seamless experience for developers working on payment-related features.

- **Realistic testing environment:** By utilizing MPay developers can create a realistic and controlled testing environment, reducing the need for reliance on external payment gateways during the development and testing phases.

- **Secure and private:** As a self-contained mock service, MPay ensures that sensitive payment information is not transmitted or stored, providing an added layer of security during development and testing activities.

## Configuration
MPay configuration can be adjusted with `ENVIRONMENT` variables or by providing `-e` parameter with configuration name on docker container run, i.e.

## Workflow

## Endpoints
Here is the list of you get all the possible options to explore MPay API. 

Have fun playing with it! üèÑ

### Swagger
You can explore MPay endpoints with swagger on development mode. Set `Environment` to `Development` to enable it.
```
docker run -it -p 5000:80 -e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development krystianczaplicki/mpay
```
Swagger is available on route http://localhost:5000/swagger.

### REST Client
MPay supports explore API with [REST Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) for Visual Studio Code.

API Requests are in [MPay.rest](https://github.com/KCzaplicki/MPay/blob/main/api/src/MPay.API/MPay.rest) file, open it in Visual Studio Code.

Don't forget to set proper `@url` value before you start making requests.

### API Docs
You can explore MPay API endpoints from manual documentation.
